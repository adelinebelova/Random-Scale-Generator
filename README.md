# Random Scale Generator 

This project was created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** 

Random Scale Generator allows the user to select which category of scales they would like to play (major, minor, etc.), then randomly generates a scale/key within that category. This allows the user to practice scales in a random order to further improve memorization and technique.
